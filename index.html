<h1>Apple in pure HTML</h1>
<p>No CSS or JS. Just HTML, the way Tim Berners-Lee intended.</p>
<p>This may be laggy on the first run, because your browser has to load the pages. If you want to, you can click on Go, go to another tab wait until the animation is finished, and then try it again for the proper speed.</p>
